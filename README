This repository contains a QML plugin which provides a convenience
type to allow client applications to easily embed the Sailfish OS
Browser WebView into their own application in order to render web
webcontent.

Note: currently you have to explicitly link against qtmozembed-qt5
at build time, to avoid a symbol issue which leads to a crash:
CONFIG += link_pkgconfig
PKGCONFIG += qt5embedwidget

Example:

import QtQuick 2.0
import Sailfish.Silica 1.0
import Sailfish.WebView 1.0

ApplicationWindow {
    id: root
    initialPage: Component {
        Page {
            WebView {
                anchors.fill: parent
                url: "http://www.sailfishos.org"
            }
        }
    }
}
